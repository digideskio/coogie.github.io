        <p>
            Working as part of the Paddy Power Sportsbook team, helping deliver a consistent and easy-to-use experience to millions of users per month by improving page performance and usability. Improving the lives and mental stability of in-house developers by refactoring HTML and CSS.

        <h3 class="h6">In-play Betting Pages <small class="muted"><a href="http://live.paddypower.com">http://live.paddypower.com/</a> | <time datetime="2015-12-01">Dec. 2014</time></small></h3>
        <p>
            Paddy Power's newest In-play Betting Pages were created as part of an initiative to create more in-house, best-in-class, products that would provide value to the company while simultaneously reducing depenencies on third-party clients. These pages use a number of new technologies such as AngularJS and WebSockets for realtime price updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of working on the core functionality of the site, I also developed the initial project structure to allow the project to scale painlessly, as well as created an extensive Gruntfile that would handle a large number of tasks that were responsible for building the source files, committing the newly-built files to Git, and automatically versioning the project according to <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a>. These Grunt tasks were also responsible for various other tasks such as compiling Sass files to CSS and the minification &amp; optimisation of all JavaScript.

        <h3 class="h6">Abacus CSS Framework <small class="muted">2016</small></h3>
        <p>
            The Abacus CSS Framework is a powerful, modular, and lightweight CSS component library built using <abbr title="Object-oriented CSS">OOCSS</abbr> and <abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr> notation, for use across all Paddy Power sites and products. It features a powerful mobile-first grid system, incredibly flexible components and is capable of delivering the entirety of Paddy Power's online branding and style, as well as full structure and layout support for mobile-first development in <strong>just 9KiB</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is a slacktime project that I created to help intertwine the Web Development and Product Design teams to get them to communicate more, and help bring consistency to Paddy Power's branding and design across our entire online portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has given designers the ability to easily update the look and feel of all Paddy Power's online products, allowing them to confidently make changes while reducing the dependency on developers to make said changes on their behalf - freeing up valuable time for other projects.

            <li>
                Successfully advocated for the use of <a href="https://www.pyrocms.com/">PyroCMS</a> on several of our microsites to allow hoteliers a friendly and easy interface to update their sites. The decision to use PyroCMS was based on the need for a CMS that was not only extremely lightweight and easy for customers to use, but was quick and easy to theme for.
            </li>
            <li>
                Completely redesigned and redeveloped the company's booking engine, offered to hoteliers for use on their own websites, and drastically improved UX resulting in increased conversion across many existing sites.

            <li>
                Introduced the use of the <a href="http://www.lesscss.org/">LESS CSS pre-processor</a> which decreased development time and enabled us to keep third-party libraries and code up-to-date with great ease.

            I was contracted by the studio to establish their online presence with a website. The website was initially raw HTML with PHP used to create includes for the header and footer and was my first foray into PHP. I have since rewritten the code and implemented PyroCMS for the backend to allow the client to update the site as they see fit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Relationship with the client has steadily grown and recurring work with them has included the design of business cards and large-scale advertising banners.

        <p>
            Gazebo is an open-source application for managing Dungeons &amp; Dragons groups, currently in planning stages. The purpose of the app is to familiarise myself with JavaScript MV* stacks such as <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, or <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>. At the moment, I'm leaning more towards Angular. <small class="muted">HAH! Leaning! Angular! No...?</small>
        </p>

        <p>
            The app will allow the tracking of members of the group, shared information between group members, individual encounters, and eventually track in-depth data such as damage per player, per encounter.

    <h1 class="h2 title--indent">Education</h1>

    <p>
        I'm largely self-taught when it comes to front-end web development and have acquired these skills over the past few years by following blogs and tutorials by some of the most respected individuals in the industry such as <a href="//paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, <a href="//css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="//davidwalsh.name/">David Walsh</a>, and <a href="//csswizardry.com/">Harry Roberts</a> - to name but a few.
    </p>

    <p>That being said, I <em>have</em> finished the following course:</p>

            <li>Completed course with First Class Honours.</li>
            <li>Was elected class representative.
